            <p>Hello! My name is Maxim Person and I am the primary owner of Maxim Rafting. I have been married for six years to my beautiful wife Micheala. We have two very boisterous and energetic children that keep us on our toes at all times. We currently live in DeWitt, Michigan but I am originally from Gaithersburg, Maryland. I moved around a lot growing up due to my father being in the military so I have had the privilage to have lived in and visited many beautiful places such as Ancorage, Alaska. There, I learned to kayak, canoe, and raft in the harshest of conditions and in time, mastered those helpful skills. This has bestowed in me a desire to spread this knowledge of high adventure to others so that they too can experience everything that rafting has to offer.  </p>
